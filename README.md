## JSON By The Other Elephant
The talk was done at the [PHP Usergroup Berlin](http://bephpug.de/) on the 7th of July 2015.
Target was to give an impression of what PostgreSQL is able to do with its JSON features.

### Data source used in this talk
As database I used the [Sakila](http://dev.mysql.com/doc/index-other.html) database from MySQL.
I've loaded the data into a MariaDB server and used [pgloader] (http://pgloader.io/) to get that data into a PostgreSQL database server.
